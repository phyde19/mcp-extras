## Resources vs Tools

from https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools:

"Tools are designed to be model-controlled, meaning that tools are exposed from servers to clients with the intention of the AI model being able to automatically invoke them (with a human in the loop to grant approval)."

And this is different to resources:
https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources:

"Resources are designed to be application-controlled, meaning that the client application can decide how and when they should be used. Different MCP clients may handle resources differently."
