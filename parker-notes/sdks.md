Every first‑party SDK release (Python, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C#) is generated straight from the tagged schema.ts, and its CI blocks the publish if any type drifts. So those SDKs do “precisely conform” to the spec version they declare.
Community ports and older releases can lag or diverge, so “all implementations” is too strong.

Why the canonical SDKs stay in lock‑step

Proof	What it tells us
Python‑SDK README states the library is “generated from the official schema” and links the spec as single source of truth 
GitHub
TypeScript SDK package.json—every release bump (e.g., 1.10.1) coincides with a schema‑tag bump (2024‑11‑05 → 2025‑03‑26). Release notes say “synced to spec tag X” 
GitHub
CI in each repo runs a script that re‑derives types from schema.ts; if the diff isn’t empty the build fails (visible in the Actions logs)

Janix‑ai/mcp‑protocol‑validator is an open‑source conformance harness used by SDK CI and recommended to third‑party servers
