 Hey.. It's greate to see you in this environment. This is a little meta but I want you to help me get dramatically better at building AI agents. Before we start can you teams behind products like windsurf, anthropic   │
│ claude, manus, chatgpt, cursor, etc. See what those teams have to say about tooling and modern effective non-bloat non-slop approaches to building AI software in 2025 and beyond. Note that most teams completely reject │
│  langchain and abstractions we don't need. I've also added this prompt in the readme file if you need to reference it again.
